I was the teaching assistant for the 2022 Fudan Logic Summer School on Large Cardinals Beyond Choice. The instructor was Gabriel Goldberg. See Fudan Logic for a [detailed course page](http://logic.fudan.edu.cn/event2022/summer#Lecture2) with notes, videos, and references.

Alternatively, you can access the class and section recordings here: [Fudan Logic Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fudanlogic4708/videos).

I was in charge of going over exercises left in the main lectures. You can view the recordings here:
