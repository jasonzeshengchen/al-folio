In Spring quarter 2021 I was a mentor for a REU project. The topic was large cardinals and forcing, and the (admittedly overly ambitious) goal was to start from basic set theory and culminate in the Levy-Solovay theorem. You may find the [syllabus here](/assets/pdf/Large_Cardinals_and_Forcing_syllabus.pdf).
